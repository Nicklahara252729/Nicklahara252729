Hi 👋 My name is Nic
====================

Civilians 👨‍💻
---------------

just ordinary civilians who love programming and algorithms sometimes also like design. started programming since school in 2014, you can see from the repository that I created, starting from the year of manufacture. not all sources are made by myself, there are some source code made by others that I still save for learning materials. There is a label that distinguishes between mine and others. I studied algorithms since college, at first I really hated algorithms like backpropagation neural netorwk, NWC, stepping stone, naive bayes. Over time the more curious finally really like it. If I'm bored, sometimes I design fad like UI/UX. I like to learn new things and you can see my learning progress on this account
